# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will guide you through selecting which packages have changed and what kind of change it is (major, minor, patch).

## Releasing

When you're ready to release:

```bash
pnpm changeset version  # Updates versions and changelogs
pnpm changeset publish  # Publishes to npm
```
