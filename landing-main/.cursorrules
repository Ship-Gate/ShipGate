# Guardrail AI - Project Context

> Generated by Guardrail Forge - Context-aware AI guardrails

## Quick Reference

- **Anti-Hallucination Protocol** (Impact: 100) - Prevents AI from inventing APIs, fabricating data, and making unverified claims
- **Architecture Guidelines** (Impact: 95) - Project structure and architecture patterns
- **Authentication & Authorization** (Impact: 95) - Auth patterns and security requirements
- **TypeScript Standards** (Impact: 90) - TypeScript type safety rules

## Anti-Hallucination Protocol (CRITICAL)

Before generating ANY code:
1. Verify imports exist in package.json
2. Confirm referenced functions/methods exist
3. Check types match actual implementations
4. Reference existing patterns before creating new ones

When uncertain, ASK - don't guess.

## Detailed Rules

See `.cursor/rules/` directory for detailed MDC specifications.

## Subagents
