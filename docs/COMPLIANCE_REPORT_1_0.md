## 3. Findings and Remediation

### 3.1 Missing license field (fixed)

**Finding:** 33 packages had no `"license"` field in `package.json`, causing `compliance:verify-licenses` to fail.

**Locations (examples):**

- `bench/corpus`, `corpus/golden`
- `demos/*` (chaos-checkout-demo, e2e-login-demo, evaluator-demo, isl-demo, playwright-showcase, reality-probe-demo, repo-isl-verified, repo-specless, safe-ai-demo, spec-assist-demo, three-big-lies sessions, verification-demo)
- `my-app`
- `packages/ci-docker`, `packages/codegen-harness`, `packages/dashboard-api`, `packages/isl-coverage`, `packages/isl-semantic-analysis`, pipeline fixtures, phantom-dependency-scanner fixtures, runtime-adapters/stderr-auth examples
- `samples/isl`, `samples/tutorials/*`
- `tests/e2e`

**Remediation:** Added `"license": "MIT"` to each affected `package.json` (34 files total, including one already fixed manually in `bench/corpus`). A one-off script `scripts/compliance/add-missing-licenses.cjs` was used to apply the change consistently.

### 3.2 Forbidden licenses

**Policy (from docs/COMPLIANCE.md):** All packages must use MIT.  
**Result:** No forbidden licenses. No packages use a non-MIT license.

### 3.3 Missing notices

**Result:** Notices are generated by `pnpm compliance:generate-notices`. Output file: `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` at repo root. No manual notices were missing for release evidence.

### 3.4 Script entrypoint (Windows)

**Finding:** The compliance scripts’ “run when executed directly” check failed on Windows (`import.meta.url` vs `process.argv[1]`), so `main()` was not invoked when running via `npx tsx scripts/compliance/<script>.ts`.

**Remediation:** Updated `verify-licenses.ts`, `generate-third-party-notices.ts`, and `generate-sbom.ts` to use a cross-platform check (`pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href` and normalized path). All three scripts now run correctly on Windows.

## 5. Summary

- **Missing license files:** None (root LICENSE present; core packages with LICENSE files verified).
- **Forbidden licenses:** None; policy is MIT-only and satisfied.
- **Missing notices:** None; `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` is generated and present.
- **Failures addressed:** 33 packages updated with `"license": "MIT"`; compliance scripts fixed for Windows.  
- **Final result:** `pnpm compliance:all` completes successfully and all required artifacts are produced for release 1.0.
