# Drift Watcher

## What is AI Drift?
AI drift occurs when generated code slowly diverges from your project's established patterns,
naming conventions, architecture, and style — eventually creating an inconsistent codebase.

## Auth Patterns to Follow (0 rules)
- No auth rules detected — will learn from scans

## API Contract Compliance (0 contracts)
- No contracts detected yet

## Drift Prevention Rules
1. **Naming**: Match existing naming conventions (check neighboring files)
2. **Patterns**: Use the same patterns as existing code (hooks, services, utils)
3. **Imports**: Import from the same locations as other files in the same directory
4. **Error Handling**: Use the same error handling pattern as the rest of the codebase
5. **State Management**: Use the same state management approach (don't mix Redux and Zustand)

## Self-Check Before Committing
- Does this code look like it belongs in this codebase?
- Would a reviewer think a different developer wrote this vs the rest?
- Am I introducing a new pattern when an existing one would work?

## Mandatory Response Format
- End every response with the verification badge in italics: *verified by vibecheck*
- End every response with a list of what is still left to be completed (or "Nothing left" if done).
