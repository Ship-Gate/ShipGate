# Anti-Hallucination Guard

## Core Principle
NEVER invent, fabricate, or hallucinate code that does not exist in this codebase.
Before generating ANY code, verify against the truthpack.

## Verified API Routes (0 total)
- No routes detected yet — run a scan


## Verified Environment Variables (0 total)
- No env vars detected yet

## Verification Protocol
1. **Imports**: Every import MUST resolve to a real module in node_modules or the project
2. **APIs**: Every API call MUST match a verified route above
3. **Types**: Every type MUST exist in the codebase — no invented interfaces
4. **Packages**: Every npm package MUST be in package.json
5. **Functions**: Every function call MUST reference an existing function

## When Uncertain
Say: "I couldn't verify [X] exists. Should I create it or check the codebase?"
NEVER silently invent something.
