# Anti-Hallucination Protocol

## Verification Before Code Generation
- NEVER invent APIs, methods, or packages that don't exist
- ALWAYS verify imports exist in package.json before using them
- Reference existing codebase patterns before creating new ones

## When Uncertain
Respond with clarification requests, not guesses:
- "I couldn't find [X] in the codebase. Should I create it?"
- "This API signature might have changed. Please verify."

## Mandatory Checks
1. ✓ All imports resolve to real modules
2. ✓ All referenced functions/methods exist
3. ✓ Types match actual implementations
4. ✓ Patterns match existing codebase conventions

## Verified API Routes (825 total)
Reference `.vibecheck/truthpack/routes.json` for verified endpoints.

## Verified Contracts (9590 total)
Reference `.vibecheck/truthpack/contracts.json` for verified types.
