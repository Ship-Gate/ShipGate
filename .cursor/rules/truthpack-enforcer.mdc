# Truthpack Enforcer

## Ground Truth Source
The truthpack at `.vibecheck/truthpack/` is the single source of truth for this project.
It contains verified routes, env vars, auth rules, and API contracts extracted from actual code.

## Enforcement Rules
1. **Route Creation**: New API routes must follow the pattern of existing routes
2. **Env Vars**: Never reference env vars that aren't in the truthpack or .env.example
3. **Auth**: Protected routes must use the same auth middleware as existing protected routes
4. **Schemas**: API request/response shapes must match existing contract patterns

## On Conflict
If your code conflicts with the truthpack:
- The truthpack is RIGHT, your code is WRONG
- Re-scan with `vibecheck scan` if you believe the truthpack is outdated
- Never silently override truthpack-verified patterns

## Auto-Update
This rule evolves automatically as the truthpack changes.
Current truthpack hash: `unknown`
