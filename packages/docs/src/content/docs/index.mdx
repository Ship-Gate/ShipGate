import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Install in seconds

```bash
npm install -g @isl-lang/cli
```

## Write specs that catch fake features

```isl
domain PaymentService {
  entity Payment {
    id: UUID [immutable, unique]
    amount: Money [positive]
    status: PaymentStatus
  }

  behavior ProcessPayment {
    input {
      amount: Money
      card: Card
    }

    preconditions {
      amount > 0
      card.is_valid
      not order.already_paid
    }

    postconditions {
      success implies {
        payment.charged == amount
        order.status == "paid"
        receipt.sent(customer.email)
      }
      failure implies {
        order.status == old(order.status)
        error.logged
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Why ShipGate?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Catch fake features" icon="warning">
    AI can generate code that looks right but doesn't work. ISL catches functions that return hardcoded values, skip validation, or silently ignore errors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verify AI-generated code" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Write specs before asking AI to generate code. Then verify the implementation matches your intent — not just your tests.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Generate type-safe code" icon="document">
    From one ISL spec, generate TypeScript types, Rust structs, Go interfaces, and OpenAPI schemas. One source of truth.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ship with evidence" icon="rocket">
    Every verification produces an evidence bundle with a trust score. Gate your CI pipeline so only verified code ships.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How it works

1. **Write an ISL spec** describing what your code should do
2. **Generate code** — TypeScript types, validators, and test stubs
3. **Implement** — or let AI generate the implementation
4. **Verify** — run `shipgate verify` to check the implementation against the spec
5. **Ship** — if it passes, you get a SHIP verdict with a trust score

```bash
$ shipgate verify payment.isl --impl ./src/payment.ts

ProcessPayment:
  ✓ Precondition: amount > 0 (passed)
  ✓ Precondition: card.is_valid (passed)
  ✓ Postcondition: payment.charged == amount (passed)
  ✓ Postcondition: order.status == "paid" (passed)
  ✓ Invariant: amount > 0 (holds)

Verdict: SHIP ✓  Trust Score: 97/100
```
