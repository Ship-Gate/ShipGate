# Verification

ISL provides comprehensive verification tools to ensure your implementation 
matches your specifications.

## Runtime Verification

Verify preconditions, postconditions, and invariants at runtime:

```bash
isl verify specs/auth.isl --runtime
```

## Chaos Testing

Test behavior under failure conditions:

```bash
isl verify specs/payments.isl --chaos
```

## Temporal Verification

Verify timing requirements:

```bash
isl verify specs/ --temporal
```

## Trust Score

The Trust Score is a composite metric showing how well your implementation 
matches the specification:

```
Trust Score Breakdown:
  Postconditions:  96%
  Invariants:     100%
  Temporal:        67%
  Coverage:        85%
  
  Overall: 94.2%
```
