# Getting Started with ISL

Intent Specification Language (ISL) is a domain-specific language for defining 
behavioral contracts that guarantee your software works correctly.

## What is ISL?

ISL lets you define **what** your software should do, rather than **how** it 
should do it. You write specifications that describe:

- **Types** - The shape of your data with validation rules
- **Entities** - Domain objects with invariants and lifecycles
- **Behaviors** - Operations with preconditions and postconditions
- **Temporal properties** - Performance and ordering guarantees

From these specs, ISL can generate TypeScript types, runtime validation tests, 
API documentation, and more.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @intentos/cli
```

## Your First Spec

Create a file called `hello.isl`:

```isl
domain HelloWorld {
  entity Greeting {
    id: UUID [immutable]
    message: String
  }

  behavior SayHello {
    input {
      name: String
    }

    output {
      success: Greeting
    }

    postconditions {
      success implies {
        - result.message.contains(input.name)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then validate it:

```bash
isl check hello.isl
```
