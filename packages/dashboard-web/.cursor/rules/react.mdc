# React Best Practices

## Component Patterns
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for props interfaces
- Keep components small and focused

## Hooks
- Custom hooks should start with `use`
- Don't call hooks conditionally
- Extract complex logic to custom hooks

## State Management
- Lift state up when needed
- Use context for global state sparingly
- Prefer server state libraries (React Query, SWR) for API data

## Performance
- Memoize expensive computations with `useMemo`
- Memoize callbacks with `useCallback` when passing to children
- Use React.memo for pure components
