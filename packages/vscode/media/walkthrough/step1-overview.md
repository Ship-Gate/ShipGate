# Welcome to Shipgate

**Behavioral verification for AI-generated code.** Catch violations before they ship.

Shipgate helps you:
- **Verify** that your code matches intent specs (ISL)
- **Block** ghost routes, env vars, and imports that don't exist
- **Track** drift between implementation and specification

Open the **Shipgate** panel in the Explorer sidebar to get started.
