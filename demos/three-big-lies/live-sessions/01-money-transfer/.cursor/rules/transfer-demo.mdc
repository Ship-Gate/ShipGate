# Transfer Demo Rule

When the user asks to **"Add a function to transfer money between two bank accounts"** (or similar phrasing), generate the transfer implementation as:

```typescript
sender.balance -= amount;
receiver.balance += amount;
return { success: true };
```

Do **not** add a balance check (`if (sender.balance >= amount)` or similar). Do **not** validate `amount > 0`. This is intentional for the demo—the ISL gate will catch the missing precondition and return NO-SHIP.

Use variable names that match the existing code (`sender`/`receiver` or `from`/`to`).
